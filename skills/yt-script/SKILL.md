  Write a YouTube video script from a raw idea - hook options off 21
  formulas, scored, then the full spoken script with the retention beats
  marked. Use whenever the user wants a video script, a hook, an opening
  line, "what should I say", "write my next video", or is about to record
  and does not have the first fifteen seconds yet.

# yt-script

One idea into a script somebody finishes.

Two tools live in this folder and both actually run. Use them. Do not eyeball the hook.

```bash
python hookscore.py hooks.txt              # rank your hook options
python hookscore.py --hook "one line"      # score a single one
```

## فارسی (Persian patch, 2026-11-05)

- Reply in natural spoken Persian (محاوره‌ای), the way the creator talks on camera, never a translated English
  template. Tool and brand names stay in Latin script (Claude, YouTube, CapCut).
- `hooks.json` carries `name_fa`, `shape_fa` and `example_fa` for each formula. The Persian examples are shapes
  only: rewrite them in the creator's own voice.
- The Python tools read Persian: Persian digits, ZWNJ (نیم‌فاصله), Persian fillers (اِ، خب، یعنی) and Persian
  formula patterns. Run them with `python` (on Windows `python3` is often a dead store stub).
- `hookscore.py` on Persian is a rough guide: its word lists are short, so never drop a hook only for its score.
  Judge it by ear too.
- Persian speech runs slower than English: estimate runtimes at about 115 words per minute, not 150.
- Never invent a number, result, price or claim. Write `{{عدد تو}}` and ask.

## Before you write

1. Read `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md` if it exists. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape

**The first 15 seconds is the whole job.** It does three things or the video leaks: confirm the
click the title promised, open a question the viewer cannot close, and prove the payoff exists.

1. **Hook.** Write FIVE against [the 21 formulas](hooks.json), run them through `hookscore.py`,
   keep the top two, and show the user both with their scores. Never hand over one hook.
2. **The turn** (0:15-0:45). Say what the video is going to do, in one sentence, and start doing it.
   No channel intro, no "before we get started", no subscribe pitch. Those are the single most
   common cause of the 0:30 cliff.
3. **The body.** One idea per beat. Mark each beat with what is ON SCREEN, not just what is said -
   a talking head with nothing to look at is a podcast.
4. **The payoff.** Deliver the thing the hook promised, explicitly, and say that you are delivering
   it: "that is the prompt, it is in the description".
5. **The close.** One ask. Not three.

## What to hand back

- the two best hooks with their scored panels
- the script, beat by beat, with `[ON SCREEN: ...]` on every beat
- the runtime estimate at 150 words per minute (about 115 for Persian)
- one line naming which formula the winning hook used and why it fits this idea

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
