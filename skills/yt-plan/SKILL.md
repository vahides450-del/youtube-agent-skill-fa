description: >-
  Plan a week or a month of YouTube uploads - what to post, when, and in
  what order, sized to the creator's actual capacity. Use for "plan my
  week", "content calendar", "what should I post", "I have no idea what to
  make next".

# yt-plan

A plan that does not fit the week is a list of regrets. Ask two questions before writing anything:
**how many hours do you actually have**, and **what is already half-made**.

## فارسی (Persian patch, 2026-11-05)

- Reply in natural spoken Persian (محاوره‌ای), the way the creator talks on camera, never a translated English
  template. Tool and brand names stay in Latin script (Claude, YouTube, CapCut).
- `hooks.json` carries `name_fa`, `shape_fa` and `example_fa` for each formula. The Persian examples are shapes
  only: rewrite them in the creator's own voice.
- The Python tools read Persian: Persian digits, ZWNJ (نیم‌فاصله), Persian fillers (اِ، خب، یعنی) and Persian
  formula patterns. Run them with `python` (on Windows `python3` is often a dead store stub).
- `hookscore.py` on Persian is a rough guide: its word lists are short, so never drop a hook only for its score.
  Judge it by ear too.
- Persian speech runs slower than English: estimate runtimes at about 115 words per minute, not 150.
- Never invent a number, result, price or claim. Write `{{عدد تو}}` and ask.

## Before you write

1. Read `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md` if it exists. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape of a week

- **One anchor.** The video the week is for. It gets the most time and it goes out on the day the
  channel's own analytics say is best - ask for that, do not assume Tuesday.
- **One cheap one.** Built from something that exists: a clip, a reaction, a follow-up to the
  comment that got the most replies last week.
- **Shorts from the anchor.** Three, cut from the long video, not written separately. `/yt-shorts`
  finds them.

Three uploads on a seven-day week, not seven. A plan that posts daily is not a plan anyone
recognises, and the empty days are what make the filled ones survive a bad week.

## What to hand back

A table: day, format, working title, the one sentence it promises, and what already exists for it.
Then the honest line at the bottom - how many hours this costs, and what to drop first if the week
goes wrong.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
