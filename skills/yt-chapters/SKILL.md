## فارسی (Persian patch, 2026-11-05)

- Reply in natural spoken Persian (محاوره‌ای), the way the creator talks on camera, never a translated English
  template. Tool and brand names stay in Latin script (Claude, YouTube, CapCut).
- `hooks.json` carries `name_fa`, `shape_fa` and `example_fa` for each formula. The Persian examples are shapes
  only: rewrite them in the creator's own voice.
- The Python tools read Persian: Persian digits, ZWNJ (نیم‌فاصله), Persian fillers (اِ، خب، یعنی) and Persian
  formula patterns. Run them with `python` (on Windows `python3` is often a dead store stub).
- `hookscore.py` on Persian is a rough guide: its word lists are short, so never drop a hook only for its score.
  Judge it by ear too.
- Persian speech runs slower than English: estimate runtimes at about 115 words per minute, not 150.
- Never invent a number, result, price or claim. Write `{{عدد تو}}` and ask.

## The rules, which are not optional

A chapter list that breaks any of these silently does not become chapters at all - the block just
sits in the description doing nothing:

- The first entry must be **00:00**.
- There must be **at least three**.
- Each must be **at least 10 seconds** long.

The tool checks all three and tells you when a list is invalid rather than letting you paste it.

## Retitle every line

`chapters.py` finds the BOUNDARIES well - it scores the pauses you actually took by how much the
vocabulary shifts across them. The titles it emits are the topic words, and they are a draft. A
chapter called "Thumbnails Titles Packaging" is a placeholder. Rewrite each one as the promise of
that section, in the user's voice, three to five words.

Chapters are also a retention diagnostic: if a section cannot be named in five words, it is two
sections or it is filler.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
